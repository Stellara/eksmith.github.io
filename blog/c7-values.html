        <p class="post-content">
     		Last week, I talked about my experiences with stereotype threat and how deeply ingrained it's been in my life without me realizing it. By the end of the post I touched on some ways to combat stereotype threat, but didn't dive incredibly deeply into it. This week, I'll examine that a little further: how to build resilience and a sense of wholeness through self-validation.

        <h2 class="subtopic">Finding the Light</h2> 
        <h3 class="subsubtopic">Personal Values</h3>

        <p class="post-content">
    		From the <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/reduce.html#encouragingself">preeminent site on the topic</a>, "A general means for protecting the self from perceived threats and the consequences of failure is to allow people to affirm their self-worth. This can be done by encouraging people to think about their characteristics, skills, values, or roles that they value or view as important."
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
    		I value more things than I can easily list, but when I think back to times I felt happiest and most fulfilled, I think that these values were being honored: affection, community, competence, creativity, helping others, self-respect, spirituality, willpower. There are so many more values beyond just those that are applicable, but those stick out the most to me when measured against my memories. I think that I exercise a lot of integrity in trying to live up to these values. I think that my actions flow from them and reflect them, but of course I am not perfect and it is a constant journey. 
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
        	If I have to choose one value of those I listed, I would choose willpower. It's something I am working very hard to cultivate right now within myself and I think it is a core characteristic that so many other grow from. Will-power allows me to achieve my goals in the face of unfavorable odds, it allows me to straighten my spine and throw my head back in the face of someone telling me in some way, "You can't do that." Honoring this value has helped me a lot so far in my journey through DBC and in my journey toward achieving the level of health and fitness that I desire and I can only see it continuing to serve me well as we embark upon Phase 1 of DBC. I think will-power is like a seed and that the other values I hold dear grow from it.

        <h2 class="subtopic">My Shield and My Sword</h2>

        <p class="post-content">
        	In a field study of seventh graders <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_cohen_garcia_apfel_master.html">(Cohen, Garcia, Apfel, and Master (2006))</a> at racially diverse schools, those who performed just one 15 minute self-affirmation task were shown to have increased academic performance during the rest of the semester. "As reflected in their end-of-semester GPAs, African-American students who had been led to self-affirm performed .3 grade points better during the semester than those who had not. Moreover, African-Americans who self-affirmed showed lower accessibility of racial stereotypes on a word fragment completion task."
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
        	As the study's conclusions suggest, the mind is powerful and the stories we tell ourselves <em>about</em> ourselves can trump anything else anyone has to say. This is an especially powerful tool to combat stereotype threat with, because the threat is insidious, overwhelming, and can seep into our subconsciousness from all directions. It can be inadvertent and often very hard to see and explicitly name. We can arm ourselves in the same manner that the attacks come in, by sending messages to our subconscious about how we see ourselves. 
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
        	Something silly that I do, as a lover of roleplaying games, is to often envision myself as a paladin with a mirrored shield. I use this mental image against the false stories much of the world would seek to tell me about myself. Willpower is actually a "stat", in most roleplaying games. It's a number that represents a character's ability to combat mental threats. From wikipedia, "A measure of the character's mental resistance (against pain, fear etc.) when falling victim to mind-altering magic, torture, or insanity. Many games combine willpower and wisdom." It's a fictional and numerical reflection of a set of real world behaviors and traits, but for me, there is some benefit to incorporating both the real world definition and the roleplaying definition into a useful tool for affirmation and to harness as a strength. The practical realization of this is that I think about how far I have come, I remind myself of my achievements, and I list my strengths. These actions help me to strengthen my self-concept. It's like polishing my mirrored shield.

        <p class="post-content">
        	Now that stereotype threat is solidly in my field of vision, it's no longer this monster in the dark. It has a name, it has a shape, and I am equipped with tools to fight it.
