      <h2 class="subtopic">Putting Yourself Out There</h2>

      <p class="post-content">
        A lot of the things we do at Dev Bootcamp put us in a place of vulnerablility. We are learning, so we often don't have the answers and have to expose our ignorance. We're also creating and send our creations onto Github for our cohorts and the world to see and our cohorts leave us feedback about interacting with us and the work that we've done. We have to put ourselves out there. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
         When I first learned that we'd be pair programming at DBC, I thought I'd hate it. For anyone unfamiliar with the term, it's an agile software development technique where two programmers work on one machine on the same piece of code together. One developer is the "driver" who is actively typing the code, while the other works as the "navigator" who reviews the code and guides the driver verbally. We do it twice a week at DBC to prepare us for real world working environments. When I came across the first assignment asking us to be active on our Twitter accounts, I thought I'd hate that too. I even groaned when I learned I'd have to keep this blog. I am a self-described introvert and while I try not to box myself in with that label, I still think it accurately describes a lot of my tendencies. I love other people, but I'm not a big talker and I guard my solitude. I also tend to think a whole lot before I say something, and that makes it difficult to talk when my brain is busy working on a hard problem at the same time. Those activities put me in a place of vulnerability. I entered Dev Bootcamp though with the mindset that I would do whatever it takes to be successful and I decided to frame those things I didn't want to do as ways to grow, to transform. DBC's core ideal that feedback and interaction should be kind, actionable, and specific makes being vulnerable possible. Brené Brown also says that "staying vulnerable is a risk we have to take if we want to experience connection", and I have experienced that firsthand. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Pair Programming</h2>

      <p class="post-content"> 
        Pairing so far has definitely been transformative. The necessity of clearly articulating myself when explaining my idea for a solution or what I think the code is doing also forces me to understand it very well. At times it's been painful to stretch this muscle, like when I feel misunderstood or ignored (when really I just didn't say what I meant), but it's part of the growth process. Pairing has been fun at times and frustrating at others, but it's always been rewarding by the end of it. I think that DBC is definitely doing something right in its admissions process, because the people I have paired with have run the gamut in diversity, but are all excellent, considerate communicators. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        I've read a lot of articles extolling the benefits of pairing for more experienced developers and they particularly highlight skills transfer and instant code review as benefits. I've experienced those at times, but a lot of us are on a similar technical level, so that happens less because we're all beginners. What I see as the major benefit of pairing is simply the meeting of different perspectives. 
      </p> 

      <p class="post-content">
        DBC students comes from such a wide range of experiences and backgrounds. I have met moms, veterans, entrepreneurs, teachers, translators, and scientists. Each person brings all of their past experience to bear when solving a problem, whether consciously or not, and that manifests in the different solutions they propose. There are so many equivalent or comparable ways to solve our challenges and seeing which ones the other students choose over others has been really cool. My fellow cohorts have taught me different ways to think about the concepts we're covering. I've been able to do that for them too. In opening ourselves up to the process, we've made wonderful connections. To me, that's even more important than skills transfer and because I've experienced it I am much more on board with pairing than I initially was.

      <h2 class="subtopic">Honor Your Communication Style</h2>

      <p class="post-content">
        Collaboration is absolutely vital and necessary and the world is better for it, because of all of those wonderful different perspectives that I was mentioning, but there is still space to collaborate and have interactions in the way that you need to, that is respectful and kind to your pair or teammates and also honors how you work best. If you're like me, and you don't think out loud, one of the most important things you can do for yourself and for your pair is to simply say "Do you mind if I have a moment to think about that?" Programming is hard mental work and chances are that even if you have the most seemingly gregarious, talkative pair, he or she might need that moment too. The biggest misconception I had about pairing was that it would be all talking all the time. That's definitely not the reality. We take breaks, research things, and independently try things out in IRB. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Giving and Receiving Feedback</h2>

      <p class="post-content">
        My expectation of receiving feedback was somewhat similar to that of pairing. I thought that it would be painful, that it would be an onslaught of criticism about all the ways my code was terrible and what a horrible pair I was for being too quiet. Feedback isn't that at all because the things we say must be actionable, specific, and kind. It's not about attacking the person, but it is about identifying things that could help them become stronger. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        I look forward to reading my feedback now because it's given in ways that honor my vulnerability in putting myself out there and the suggestions are ways to improve. Some of the feedback I have received, such as taking more breaks, and becoming more fluent in my dev environment are suggestions I have worked to implement and continue to work on because they were given to make me better, not to harm me or cut me down. Being on the receiving end of feedback has definitely informed the way that I give it. I'll keep improving on that end and I just recently had a conversation with someone about considerate ways to give feedback. Some helpful tips were to frame things with "I" statements rather than "you" statements, to reduce the possibility that it comes off as an attack, and to speak about the work itself whenever possible and not the person. The hardest thing about giving feedback for me, is to find constructive criticism in the first place and to not shy away from giving it. Remembering that the person I am critiquing is making themselves just as vulnerable as I am through this whole process is key.

      <p class="post-content">
          Empathy lies at the core of both successful pairing and giving and receiving feedback. At the end of the day, pairing and feedback are about communication and they are both extremely valuable tools for learning how to be great developers. Successful communication is more than just adequately conveying your thoughts to someone. It's definitely that too, but it's also about making a connection, achieving an understanding, and to adequately convey your thoughts to someone it helps to understand their context, the lenses through which they might be receiving your words. Telepaths and empaths only exist in comics, movies, and TV, and often we can only guess at someone's context or even their mood that day. We don't have power over how others react to our words, but we can deliver them in ways that minimize hurt and judgment, in ways that honor the vulnerability that both parties are experiencing by putting their ideas forth and putting their work out there. If we can do that, we will gain all the benefits of seeing different ways of solving problems and of having a second set of eyes on our code and not only will we learn how to be great developers, but we might just also learn how to be great people too.

      <h2 class="subtopic">Some Resources</h2>

      <p class="post-content">
        Shame and vulnerability shape so much about our concepts of ourselves and how we interact with others. Researcher Brené Brown has an amazing <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability?language=en"> TED talk on the power of vulnerability.</a> It's 20 minutes that might change how you see yourself.

      <p class="post-content">
        Her books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159285849X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0520271440&linkCode=as2&tag=teco06-20">The Gifts of Imperfection</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592407331/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422239974&sr=8-1&keywords=daring+greatly">Daring Greatly</a> are amazing reads as well. They help teach readers how to strive without fear of failure and how to connect without fear of judgment.
