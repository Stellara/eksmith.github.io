      Dev Bootcamp truly is reshaping what it means to be a student. Co-founder Shereef Bishay has a wonderful fireside chat at <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Kitchen vs. Table> that gets at the heart of Dev Bootcamp's philosophies and practices and I encourage you to watch it. It can apply to anyone, even seasoned developers.

        The talk centers on an analogy of learning at Dev Bootcamp as being a chef in the kitchen versus being the customer at the table in a restaurant. Dev Bootcamp is shaking up the relationship between teacher and student, moving from the model we all know where students passively receive knowledge from the teacher who serves it to them to a more organic, active relationship where students step up and take responsibility for their eduation. Shereef mentions that at Dev Bootcamp, he hopes that students have the creator mindset, which is active and seeking instead of passive and consuming.

        I think this approach is necessary, especially to learn software development. Learning never stops, not even when you've landed that developer position. You have to be hungry, passionate, active, and driven to seize knowledge and mastery. This approach, and Dev Bootcamp's focus on the developer as a whole person really drew me to the program to begin with. I longed to apply for months, but didn't take action until the opportunity came along for LocalHost in Columbus and I seized it. The program's philosophies set it apart from other coding schools and I knew this was my place. It was where I belonged.

      I am thrilled to participate in this kind of learning environment, but a little nervous also about how I will have to change and grow to succeed. I'd been learning to code for a while on my own, but I knew that something was still missing working in isolation. I needed an external push to rise to. I was letting myself hang out too long in my comfort zones. This experience so far is pushing me in ways I hadn't forseen. Shereef calls it a "true transformational rite of passage" and I think it will live up to that.

      At Dev Bootcamp, we're all in this together, we are co-creators of our experience. This throws the gauntlet down to students and gives them freedom. This more than anything drew me to the program and this more than anything I think is the keystone to why the program is so successful and the foundation upon which it's shaking up education.
