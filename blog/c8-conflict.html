     	I game a lot (well, definitely less so since entering DBC). I play video games, MMORPGs, pen and paper RPGs, card games, boardgames, the whole spectrum. Gaming is inherently prone to conflict by its nature. Most games have an antagonistic relationship between players built in. I think gaming is an interesting opportunity to see how people handle conflict and to see how you yourself handle conflict. How do you respond to conflict when there are no real stakes except your own desire to win?

        <p class="post-content"> 
        Let me tell you about a little game called <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance">The Resistance.</a> It's a "social deduction" game, which is a particular genre of boardgames where players are randomly and secretly put onto opposing teams and have limited information (if any at all) about who is on their team with them. A player knows their own "identity", such as belonging to "team bad guys" or "team good guys", and must gather information about who might be on their team during the course of the game by watching and listening to what other players do and say. Players have to figure out who is on their team and accomplish certain goals, but at any point, the other players could be lying. There's lots of bluffing and lots of deception. Social deduction games are ripe for conflict.

        <p class="post-content">
    	My most recent experience with conflict was in playing one of these games. It's a special version of The Resistance called The Resistance: Avalon, with an Arthurian legend theme. In this game, players are randomly given a facedown card from a shuffled pile telling them whether they are a "minion of Mordred" (a "bad guy" who doesn't want King Arthur's knights of the round table to find the holy grail) or a knight of the round table who wants to find the holy grail. There are a certain number of minions and a certain number of knights, depending on total players. There are a bunch of other mechanics as well, but that's the gist.  
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
    	There are tons of ways to play the game, in terms of strategy, the metagame, timing, when to lie, when not to lie, etc. There is no one "right" way. It's a highly subjective experience and everyone has their own opinion based on how much they've played the game before or their experiences with other games. This makes it incredibly difficult to discuss what should be happening during the game, because everyone ends up being very tense and you can't tell if someone's advice is being given because it's solid advice or because they're a minion of Mordred and they want you to fail at your goal. 
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
        On my most recent playthrough, I was a knight of the round table. I was looking to the behavior of another player who I knew for absolute certain was also a knight of the round table (due to mechanics that happen at the beginning of the game). He was also a brand new player. I felt that everything he did during the game was helping the "bad guys" and hurting the "good guys". At the end of the game, after knights of the round table lost, we discussed what happened. We both couldn't understand why the other took the actions that we did. He thought he definitely should have been playing one way. I thought he definitely should have been playing another. I tried to explain what my experience has shown of how certain strategies pan out, because I have played more games than he had. This put us in conflict with each other, even though we had been on the same team AND the game was already over. We were both trying to convince the other of our opinion, which is usually a pointless effort.

        <p class="post-content">
        We played a second game and we were both given the exact same cards, and we both ended up playing exactly the same way and the knights of the round table lost again. In that moment I felt immense frustration because I felt that he hadn't heard a word about what I said. I had expected that my experience with the game would lend some weight to my argument in favor of playing a certain way. I had also thought that my argument was sound and was based on logic and numbers, and that it must be very sound and of course how could he not accept it and then begin playing that way? At the end of this second game, we were in conflict again.
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
        The heart of my frustration wasn't even because of how he was playing, but it was that I felt he was dismissing my opinion because I am a woman. I experience this happen in gaming more often than I wish it did. I was the only woman at a table of 6. It might be the truth of it, but it was what I felt, because from my perspective, he seemed willing to entertain the other males' opinions. I expressed my argument again and tried to listen patiently to his. To resolve the conflict, I simply said, "There are many ways to play that role and it just takes a few playthroughs to really get it down, but please play how you'd like."
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
        If I could go back, I think I would state my frustration. I think I made a lot of assumptions and just stating those assumptions in as neutral a way as possible, might have cleared them up. He might not have been dismissing me because I am a woman, it might have been because he found my argument confusing. I don't know because I didn't ask.
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
        That experience also taught me though, that there times when I back down too quickly, too easily and more often than that - times where I don't speak my mind at all. Working on a team of any sort, whether an imaginary team of King Arthur's going on an imaginary quest for the holy grail, or on a very real project team where there are very real stakes, decisions will have to be made constantly and input will be taken from team members. My ideas might be shot down, but it definitely doesn't mean I shouldn't share them. From that experience playing that game as well as recent pairing sessions, I have learned that I'm not always right, but I do have good instincts, and when I don't fight for them, my team can end up getting derailed down the wrong path only to come back to my original idea, which would have saved us time to have gone with in the first place. I have learned that I'm not always right, my idea isn't always the one we should use, but sometimes it is, and I shouldn't give that up so easily.

        <p class="post-content">
        If you read this and thought "Huh, I don't remember boardgames being like that. Sounds fun!" <a href="http://geekandsundry.com/shows/tabletop/">Tabletop</a> is a wonderful show, where you can watch entertaining people and celebrities play boardgames (or in Wil Wheaton's case - lose boardgames). You can learn the rules of some games, see what they look like, and see what a playthrough is like. Here's a playthrough of The Resistance in action:
