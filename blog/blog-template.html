        <h3 class="subtopic">Here's Cavil being emostential</h2>  
        <p class="post-content">
           Brother Cavil: In all your travels, have you ever seen a star go supernova?  Ellen Tigh: No.  Brother Cavil: No? Well, I have. I saw a star explode and send out the building blocks of the Universe. Other stars, other planets and eventually other life. A supernova! Creation itself! I was there. I wanted to see it and be part of the moment. And you know how I perceived one of the most glorious events in the universe? With these ridiculous gelatinous orbs in my skull! With eyes designed to perceive only a tiny fraction of the EM spectrum. With ears designed only to hear vibrations in the air.  Ellen Tigh: The five of us designed you to be as human as possible.  Brother Cavil: I don't want to be human! I want to see gamma rays! I want to hear X-rays! And I want to - I want to smell dark matter! Do you see the absurdity of what I am?

        <p class="post-content">   
           I can't even express these things properly because I have to - I have to conceptualize complex ideas in this stupid limiting spoken language! But I know I want to reach out with something other than these prehensile paws! And feel the wind of a supernova flowing over me! I'm a machine! And I can know much more! I can experience so much more. But I'm trapped in this absurd body! And why? Because my five creators thought that God wanted it that way!

        <h3 class="subtopic">Adama and Kara totally flirt like they always do</h2>  
        <p class="post-content">  
          Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: So... um... that bum knee of yours is looking pretty good. And the other one's not too bad either.  Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Lee, if you want to ask me to dance, just ask.  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: You want to dance?  Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Me in a dress is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

          President Laura Roslin: [talking about Baltar] He's an odd one, isn't he?  Billy Keikeya: [in falsetto] Cuckoo...

        <p class="post-content">
          President Laura Roslin: [about Commander Adama] Maybe if he's more comfortable he'll be a little easier to deal with.  Billy Keikeya: That's smart.  President Laura Roslin: No, it's not smart. It's politics.

          Romo Lampkin: I understand that you had a romantic relationship with my client.  Number Six: Gaius Baltar is a brilliant, gifted human being. In the time I've known him, he's made a sport out of mendacity and deception. He is narcissistic, feckless, self-centered, and vain. I'm the one who should have stabbed him.  President Laura Roslin: Things are looking up.
