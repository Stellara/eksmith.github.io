      <h3 id="subtitle">The Art of Asking Questions</h3>

      <div class="post-container">
        <h4 id="date">February 22, 2015</h4>
 
        <p class="post-content"> 
        We've all heard that adage, "the only bad question is the one that doesn't get asked." It's also often phrased as "there are no bad questions". While I fundamentally think those things are true, I do think that there are <em>effective</em> questions and <em>ineffective</em> questions. The shape of the question determines the shape of the answer.
        </p>

        <p class="post-content"> 
        I asked a meta question to a potential mentor the other night. I asked him: "How can I best form my questions in a way that makes it the easiest for mentors to help me?" He gave some solid advice and suggested that an effective mentor will be able to navigate you to an answer because you might not always know enough to ask your question as clearly as you'd like.That makes sense to me, but I think that we can do our part to make that as easy as possible on the people we are asking questions of.  
        </p>

        <p class="post-content"> 
        After some reflecting on the matter, I've come up with a short list of things to consider to ask effective questions. I've found that when my questions follow these forms or when I consider these things I get the best answers: 
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Motive</li>
        	<li>Effort and Research</li>
        	<li>Specific</li>
        	<li>Is it answerable?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subsubtopic">Motive</h3>

        <p class="post-content"> 
        Motive simply examines why you are asking the question. Are you asking simply to spark debate, to get a subjective opinion or advice, or because you need an objective "right" answer to move on with an assignment or project? If you know exactly why you're asking the question, then you can shape your phrasing to weed out the types of answers that are not useful to you. Instead of asking very generally, "Which is better: Python or Ruby", which can spark a lengthy debate that's not actually useful to you in the moment, you can shape your question as something like "For this particular problem x I have right now, which language has the more appropriate features to solve it?"
        </p>

        <p class="post-content"> 
        There is a wonderful Stack Overflow article touching on this called <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/gorilla-vs-shark/">"Gorilla vs. Shark"</a>. The article is written with the context of Stack Overflow's mission, which is to provide answers everyone can use, but the principles can be applied to questions you're asking in private, just for yourself as well. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsubtopic">Effort and Research</h3>

        <p class="post-content">
        Effort and research is simply the suggestion that you try to solve your problem on your own first and research other ways to solve it. This will save you and the person you're asking time and you might just end up finding the answer on your own by spending some time on forums, with reference books, and by simply Googling. Ask your question when you are truly stuck and if you've truly tried to work it out on your own, you will be able to mention that in your problem description.This accomplishes a few things. It helps the person you're asking home in on a correct answer for you and shows that person that you are invested in your own learning and not just waiting for someone to spoon-feed you knowledge. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsubtopic">Specificity</h3>
        You're more likely to get the most effective answers when you ask specific questions. General questions leave a lot of room for misinterpretation, for subjective opinions that can potentially lead you astray, and for just plain wrong answers. You can end up saying to yourself, "But that's not what I meant." Being as specific as you can leaves no room for this. For example, instead of asking, "What are the best Ruby Enumerable methods", which is a general question whose answer would really depend on what you're trying to accomplish, you could ask, "Which Ruby methods return a new array after performing an operation on a collection?" Even better still would be to ask something like "How can I square each element of my array and return the results in a new array?" Such an example breaks our earlier guidline about effort and research, but it's just an example to show you how to narrow down your questions. 
      
        <h3 class="subsubtopic">Is it answerable?</h3>

        <p class="post-content">
        Finally, I think the most important thing you can do to ask effective questions is to make sure that they <em>can</em> have answers. If it's such an oddball, quirky question that everyone you ask is left telling you "Um...I just don't know", you're asking a very ineffective question. It might help to consider what sort of answer you'd hope to get. Do you want advice, an opinion, or specific syntax? Is the sort of answer you're looking for able to be categorized in some way? If you can't categorize the question or the potential answer, it might be a fairly unanswerable question, and that would be a time and thought waster for both you and the person you're asking. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsubtopic">Final guidelines: </h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Sum up your problem succinctly. Keep in mind time.</li>
          <li>Introduce the problem. Set context.</li>
          <li>Help others reproduce the problem.</li>
        </ul>
