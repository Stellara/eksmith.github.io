        Since Dev Bootcamp is like being in school all over again in a lot of ways, it makes sense to take some time for self-reflection about how we learn and think. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        There are all sorts of inventories, quizzes, and self-assessments you can take to discover more about how you learn and think. At the beginning of Phase 0, one tool that we used was the Gregorc Mind Styles model. It divides thinking styles into four categories: 
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Concrete Sequential</li>
        <li>Concrete Random</li>
        <li>Abstract Random</li>
        <li>Abstract Sequential</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="post-content">
        These categories are determined by how we perceive things and how we order information. From Anthony Greorc's <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Gregorc.htm">website</a>: 
      </p>

      <p id="intro-quote">   
         <span class="bold" style="color: #3AE0C5">Perceptual Quality</span>
      </p>

      <p id="intro-quote">
        <span style="color:purple">Concrete:</span> This quality enables you to register information directly through your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. When you are using your concrete ability, you are dealing with the obvious, the "here and now." You are not looking for hidden meanings, or making relationships between ideas or concepts. "It is what it is."
      </p>
      
      <p id="intro-quote">
        <span style="color:purple">Abstract:</span> This quality allows you to visualize, to conceive ideas, to understand or believe that which you cannot actually see. When you are using your abstract quality, you are using your intuition, your imagination, and you are looking beyond “what is” to the more subtle implications. "It is not always what it seems."
      </p>
 
      <p id="intro-quote">
        Although all people have both concrete and abstract perceptual abilities to some extent, each person is usually comfortable using one more than the other. The person whose natural strength in the concrete, for example, may communicate in a direct, literal, no-nonsense manner. The person whose natural strength is the abstract may use more subtle ways to get a point across.
      </p>
 
      <p id="intro-quote">   
         <span class="bold" style="color: #3AE0C5">Ordering Ability</span>
      </p>

      <p id="intro-quote">  
         <span style="color:purple">Sequential:</span> Allows your mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner. When using your sequential ability, you are following a logical train of thought, a traditional approach to dealing with information. You may also prefer to have a plan and to follow it, rather than relying on impulse.
      </p>

      <p id="intro-quote">
        <span style="color:purple">Random:</span> Lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order. When you are using your random ability, you may often be able to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result. You may even start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards. You may also prefer your life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned.
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        I tested as an Abstract Random thinker. According to Gregorc we tend to learn best in a personalized environment, when we're given general guidelines, and whenever we're able to be social and to relate to the group. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        I agree more with his characterization of the way Abstract Random learners perceive and order information more than his guidelines for how we learn best. I actually think I learn the best independently because of the random way my mind organizes information. I do tend to skip steps, and organize information in large unordered chunks. This can be frustrating for others who need things to be more regimented. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        I can use my thinking style to my advantage by starting from the top down when I learn something new at DBC. I like to see the big general picture first and to gain an initial impression. I also like to visualize concepts and problems. I can put these tendencies into beneficial practice by reading all of a challenge's README and letting it sink in first before diving into the problem. I can also use a whiteboard often to sketch out pseudocode or to diagram and conceptualize a problem. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        I have seen my thinking style come into play during Phase 0 in pairing sessions the most. I will often know the solution I'd like to implement and can just do it quickly, but I'm not always able to articulate my thought process and this can be unfair to my pairing partner. It's been a challenge for me to slow down and explain myself so that my partner and I can be on the same page. I will also have a tendency to rely on my intuition and this can also be a challenge when I need to explain why I would like to try something. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        I like my thinking style, but I need to practice more <em>concrete</em> and <em>sequential</em> traits. Especially in programming, a lot of problem solving just takes working through things slowly, step by step, with clear articulation of the process. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        I'd like to incorporate a growth mindset and expand the ways I think. My logical thinking could stand to be strengthened.
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        Learning is a process and <em>learning how to learn</em> is even more challenging. It's a skill that will benefit me through the rest of my career. It starts with self-reflection, continues with fine tuning, and never stops. I look forward to learning more about myself as I continue this journey through Dev Bootcamp.
