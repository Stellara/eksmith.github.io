        	"You have to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have."

        <p class="post-content">
     		I won't even give that quote an attribution because it doesn't truly have one. It's a sentiment that belongs to society at large, a statement that has been repeated in many different permutations, in many different settings, across decades, sometimes casually, but most often with a deadly seriousness. As I type this some parent somewhere might be in front of their child repeating it in some form, reinforcing the pattern for the next generation. 
        </p>

        <p class="post-content"> 
        	"You must be excellent" really means "You must be excellent to be <em>good enough</em>" because there is so much to be made up for. The statement "you have to be twice as good" is an overcompensation for 
        	<a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">stereotype threat</a>. If you're unfamiliar with the term, I would implore you to go read about it, even if just for a few moments. It's something I didn't know there was a term for, but that has shaped a significant portion of who I am.  
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
        	In short, stereotype threat is "Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group". Much of the research focuses of minorities and those who fall within certain socioeconomic strata, but I think that the term can apply to anyone at all because stereotypes of all sorts abound in our world.  
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
        	I am just here to speak to my experience on the issue and to reflect on it. It's hard that it's something I have lived with and continue to live with daily, that it's become such an ingrained part of my experience that I didn't think to even seek out information about it. I didn't know there was a term for it or that it was something other people studied. 
        </p>

        <p class="post-content"> 
        	This is what I mean: even my first name is the result overcompensating for stereotype threat. My mother has told me a few times that she gave me the name that she did because it looks so neutral on job applications. My family is full of names like Tenisha and Takeeya and Sharonda. My name? Erin. The Freakanomics book and documentary explore this phenomenon and there is also a <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2013/04/08/how-much-does-your-name-matter-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/">podcast</a> on this topic and the effects of distinctly "black" names. How I speak is the same case: my mother trained me to sound a certain way. I have gotten so many "compliments" when I have worked in offices from clients who have spoken with me on the phone and then have seen me in person afterward: "Wow, you sounded so professional."
        </p> 

        <p class="post-content"> 
        	My mother was just reacting to the world she had experienced and I can't even say that I am not grateful to her for it. It's a hard thing. I wonder often, "Would I have gotten into that program if I had a different name and if I had spoken in a different way during the interview?" And then there is the other, just as insidious view that I can't help but shake, "Did I only get or achieve that <em>because</em> I am black?" 
        </p>

        <p class="post-content"> 
        	I feel stereotype threat in almost every single situation I am in other than being around close friends, family, and those who know me well. This is because I am so very often the only person of any minority group at all in a room, never mind being the only black woman. I have overlapping sterotypes to combat. I feel a constant pressure to be smart, to be excellent, to be hyper aware of everyone's feelings, to be thoughtful, to speak well, to be selfless because people so often unconsciously expect women to do so. I've taken to experiencing these feelings in the background because if I have to carry them around consciously...it gets crushing. I feel stereotype threat at tech conferences, at gaming and comic book conventions that I go to, at my rock climbing gym, at my boardgaming club. 
        </p>

        <p class="post-content"> 
        	The hardest thing about dealing with stereotype threat is when I let my guard down enough and talk myself down from it and tell myself that no one is thinking of those things like I am and then...someone crushes that by reminding me that yes they are in fact. When comments such as "...for a black girl" or "I never would have guessed you were black" or "wow you're so different from other black girls" casually slip out of their mouths. Then I am sucked back into a reality I have no wish to be part of.
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
    		I don't think I am going to hit on the solution in one blog post. Not when I have been combating it my whole life and my mother has been combating it for hers and her mother before her. It is definitely something I have a mind to work on fighting as best I can though. I will continue to be who I am. I will continue to do the things that I do and I will shake this responsibility I feel for being a representative of my whole race and gender. I am just one woman and everyone makes their own choices. What I can do is to offer support to those around me who are struggling with the same issues and to really lend a hand to those who are younger and perhaps in a much more vulnerable formative space. 
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
    		  I think the most important thing any of us do when we hear sterotypes of any sort around us is to challenge them. This can be done in non-confrontational ways and in kind ways, but we cannot be complicit in their perpetuation. It takes all of us. 
        </p>

        <p class="post-content">
          The next important thing we can do? Boldly be ourselves and shatter any stereotypes we might feel chained by. It's not about "being twice as good as them" it's about being as good as you want to be for yourself. If everyone is rocking their own beat, in whatever ways that makes sense for them and brings them happiness, stereotypes can't take hold in the first place.
