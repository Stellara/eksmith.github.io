          CSS...the final frontier. These are the voyages of a halpless would be developer. Her continuing mission to explore strange new code. To seek out new styles and new div infestations. To pleadingly (while muttering profanties and making spastic gestures) get the boxes to go where they've never gone before.
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        Positioning an element using CSS is like bringing a <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Trouble_with_Tribbles_%28episode%29">tribble</a> back to the Enterprise. It won't stay where you put it and before you know it you have more elements in places they were never supposed to be.It seemed like a cute and cuddly idea at the time. <em>(I'm sure there's a better analogy, and any other Trekkies out there feel free to make one, but it won't be as cute.)</em>
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        The problem with using positioning is that if you attempt to use it without very clearly understanding what each value does, you might make more problems for yourself and make your page look worse than it would have without any positioning at all. You can generally strong arm elements where you want them to be through trial and error, by applying different values to a selector until it looks how you want it to, but that can be tedious, makes fixing bugs difficult, and can have a domino effect later if you change some other related element's position.

      <h2 class="subtopic">A preliminary scan of "space"</h2>

      <p class="post-content">
        To begin with, let's get the lay of the universe we're working in. Elements are presented on a page according to their <b>normal flow</b>. This is just where they fall into place without positioning, sort of like the effect of gravity on objects in the physical world.
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        The position property in CSS allows you to move elements where you want them to be visually, and to put them <b>out of flow</b> if you wish. The name is pretty clear and that's what you would expect for it to do. Going into the specific values that this property can take is where it gets complicated. Those values are <span class="key-terms">static</span>, <span class="key-terms">relative</span>, <span class="key-terms">absolute</span>, and <span class="key-terms">fixed</span>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Static</h2> 

      <p class="post-content">
        Anything that is not positioned is <span class="key-terms">static</span>. Elements have the static value by default if you don't give them any other value. This means they will just stack together in the normal flow that you have laid for them in your html.
      </p>

      <h3>HTML</h3>

      <pre><code> 
        &lt;body&gt;
              &lt;div id=&quot;box-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div id=&quot;box-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div id=&quot;box-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
      </code></pre> 

      <h3>CSS</h3>
      <h4>static by default</h4>

      <pre><code>
        #box-1 {
          height: 200px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: red;
        }

        #box-2 {
          height: 200px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: #EDDB15;
        }

        #box-3 {
          height: 200px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: #15B0ED;
        }
      </code></pre>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Relative</h2> 

      <p class="post-content">
        <span class="key-terms">Relative positioning</span> is a lot like <span class="key-terms">static positioning</span>, except that it allows elements to move left/right/top/bottom. The key with this positioning is that elements move in relationship to where they <em>originally</em> when they were statically positioned. When elements move in this fashion, no other element moves in to take their place, they simply leave behind the gap that they used to occupy.
      </p>


      <div class="blog-image"><img src="../imgs/relative.jpg"></div>
      <pre><code>
        #box-1 {
          height: 200px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: red;
          position: relative;
          left: 200px;
        }

        #box-2 {
          height: 200px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: #EDDB15;
        }

        #box-3 {
          height: 200px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: #15B0ED;
          position: relative;
          top: 100px;
        }
      </code></pre>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Absolute</h2>
      <p class="post-content">
        With <span class="key-terms">absolute</span> positioning, the element is positioned exactly where you want it to be. It's taken out of the <b>normal flow</b> that I showed you earlier which was just the stack of boxes. You are able to choose <em>exactly</em> where on the screen you would like for the element to appear and it goes there.  
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        One of the most important things to note about using absolute positioning is that offsetting it with left/right/bottom/top moves it relative to its nearset positioned parent instead of relative to the document. If it has no positioned parent, then it moves relative to the document.

      <p class="post-content">
        "Do not leave space for the element. Instead, position it at a specified position relative to its closest positioned ancestor or to the containing block. Absolutely positioned boxes can have margins, they do not collapse with any other margins."
      </p>

      <div class="blog-image"><img src="../imgs/absolute.jpg"></div>
      <pre><code>
        #box-1 {
          height: 200px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: red;
          position: absolute;
          left: 100px;
          top: 100px;
        }

        #box-2 {
          height: 200px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: #EDDB15;
          position: absolute;
          left: 150px;
          top: 150px;
        }

        #box-3 {
          height: 200px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: #15B0ED;
          position: absolute;
          left: 200px;
          top: 200px;
        }
      </code></pre>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Fixed</h2>
      <p class="post-content">
        The final positioning value that you'll see in common use is <span class="key-terms">fixed positioning</span>. You can think of it as gluing the element in place. Even if you scroll down the page, a fixed element will remain exactly where it is on your screen. It is immune to scrolling and behaves relative to the document, not to any parent container.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        #box-1 {
          height: 200px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: red;
          position: absolute;
          left: 100px;
          top: 100px;
        }

        #box-2 {
          height: 300px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: #EDDB15;
          position: static;
        }

        #box-3 {
          height: 300px;
          width: 200px;
          background-color: #15B0ED;
          position: static;
        }
      </code></pre>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Make it So</h2>
      <p class="post-content">
        Now, with a basic understanding of the differences between <span class="key-terms">static</span>, <span class="key-terms">relative</span>, <span class="key-terms">absolute</span>, and <span class="key-terms">fixed</span> positioning you know enough about CSS positioning to get yourself into trouble like a true red shirt. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        To avoid wrapping yourself up in utter confusion and breaking the whole layout of your page as you work, try to think carefully about what each positioning value means, what your element's parent is positioned as, and to use your Devtools liberally.
