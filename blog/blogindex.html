        The world is filled with objects that interact with each other and many of these objects are produced from some template that makes them the same in many ways, but unique in others. To make a cookie, for example, you follow some recipe that is generally the same for all cookies, but you tweak the amounts of butter, sugar, or chocolate to get different <em>kinds</em> of cookies. The existence of objects that have attributes (like amount of butter or sugar) and that have behaviors that they can do and that can be done to them (like baking or being eaten) is at the core of object oriented programming. 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content"> 
        In Ruby, we can model real world objects by using classes. In Ruby, "Cookie" would be a <span class="key-terms">class</span> and "chocolate chip cookie" would be an <span class="key-terms">instance</span> of it. A class is the general template for creating objects of its kind. An instance of that class is the specific object. Let's look at this in code: 
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Defining a Class</h2> 

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/eksmith/dd6be1e79879c72b36ec.js"></script>

      <p class="post-content">
        The is the most basic class we can define in Ruby, but it's not very interesting because we haven't given it a way to hold data and we can't interact with it because we haven't defined any behavior. To get started with a class, all you need is the <span class="key-terms">class</span> keyword, a class name that follows the naming convention by beginning with a capital letter, and the end keyword. This is just a skeleton. The working parts of your class will go in between these two lines. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Initializing a Class</h2>

      <p class="post-content">
        It's not always necessary, depending upon what you're trying to achieve, but you may want to initialize your class. 
      </p>

      <p id="intro-quote">
        <span class="key-terms">Initialize</span> is a special method in Ruby programs. When you call Song.new to create a new Song object, Ruby creates an uninitialized object and then calls that object's initialize method, passing in any parameters that were passed to new. This gives you a chance to write code that sets up your object's state. - <a href="http://phrogz.net/programmingruby/tut_classes.html">Pragmatic Programmer's Guide to Ruby</a>
      </p>

     <p class="post-content">
        This means that you will be setting variables that represent characteristics that you want each instance to have their own copies of upon creation. These characteristics are known as <span class="key-terms">instance variables.</span> Each time that you create a new instance of the class, you will give it its own specific values for these variables: 
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/eksmith/4c3340a5930ecd463bc8.js"></script>

      <p class="post-content">
        In the above example, we initialize Cookie with an amount of sugar, an amount of butter, and an amount of flour. We set chocolate to 0 by default because while every instance of cookie will have sugar, butter, and flour, not every instance will have chocolate. Different kinds of cookies have different ratios of these ingredients, but they share the fact that they are made with these ingredients. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Instance Variables</h2>

      <p class="post-content">
        When we create the chocolate_chip_cookie instance of cookie, we pass in the amounts of ingredients that are unique to chocolate chip cookies. This is what instance variables track - data about an instance of a class that is unique to that instance. Additionally, we will do this each time we create a new instance of Cookie.
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        <span class="key-terms">Instance variables</span> follow the variable naming convention of being lowercase, but begin with the @ symbol. Scope is extremely important when considering whether or not your class should have instance variables and what they should be. This simply means that we must consider where in the program the variable is accessible. Instance variables are only accessible to the object that they belong to. This means that if chocolate_chip_cookie changes its amount of sugar, it is the only instance that will be affected by that change. If we had a sugar_cookie instance of Cookie, its amount of @sugar would be untouched.  
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Instance Methods</h2>

      <p class="post-content">
        Now that we have our class, with instance variables to hold its state, we want to be able to do something what that data. Objects have both state <em>and</em> behavior. <span class="key-terms">Instance methods</span> are simply methods that are called on an individual instance of a class: 
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/eksmith/0903a4791b90d3884c4c.js"></script>
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        In the above example, we have defined the method <span class="key-terms">is_yummy?</span> which will return true or false depending on whether or not the instance of cookie that we call it on meets those conditions. When we call it on chocolate_chip_cookie, we get false, because it doesn't have enough sugar and butter to be yummy. When we call it on the sugar_cookie instance of the Cookie class, since sugar_cookie has its own state independent of chocolate_chip_cookie's, we get a true result. Looks like we need to tweak our recipe for chocolate chip cookies! 
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtopic">When would you want to use a class and why?</h2>

      <p class="post-content">
        The Well-Grounded Rubyist has wonderful advice on using classes: 
      </p>

      <p id="intro-quote">
        Definining a class lets you group behaviors (methods) into convenient bundles, so that you can quickly create many objects that behave essentially the same way.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>  
      
      <p class="post-content">
        A class is a factory for creating multiples of an object and allows for more complex interactions between objects. If you don't need to have several instances of an object, then you probably do not need a class. The class itself is useful when you're creating objects from it. 
      </p>
