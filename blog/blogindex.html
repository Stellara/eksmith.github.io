        Arrays and hashes are two of the most fundamental data structures in all of computer science. They both store collections of objects that can be accessed after their creation. They are also flexible structures and grow or shrink in size to fit the number of objects in them and they can hold a mixture of different types of objects.
      </p>

      <p class="post-content"> 
        Arrays and hashes are easy to create and use in Ruby and come with powerful built-in methods that will let you hit the ground running and start to do cool things with them very quickly. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Arrays</h2>
      <h3 class="subsubtopic">What they are and how to create them</h3>

      <p class="post-content">
        An array is most simply understood as a list of objects in order, much like a todo list you might make for youself at the start of your day or a shopping list. It can be set to a variable for later use. Here's a very basic array: 
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/eksmith/9946043ac4a0c0a96a75.js"></script>

      <p class="post-content">
        I set it to a variable called 'favorite_games' and then filled it in with string objects. This is a simple way to create an array when you already know some of the things you want to put in it.
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        You can also create a new array by calling the new method on the Array class:
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        So now we have our arrays, but how can we do things with them? What if we need to add things to the array or access just one element? 
      </p>

      <h3 class="subsubtopic">Accessing Arrays</h3>

      <p class="post-content">
        Arrays are indexed, which means that every slot in the array has a numbered "address" for where you can find its contents. It's important to note that the numbering begins with 0:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/eksmith/ece6860d6ab0c6dc0adb.js"></script>

      <p class="post-content">
        There are many useful methods for arrays. Here are a few to give you an idea of the sorts of things you can do with arrays: 
      </p>

        You can find more Array methods <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-index"/>here.</a>
      </p>

      <h2 class="subtopic">Hashes</h2> 
      <h3 class="subsubtopic">What they are and how to create them</h3>

      <p class="post-content">
        Hashes are very similar to arrays except that they are unordered and not accessed by index, and entries in a hash are key/value pairs where any object can be a key. They use curly braces {} around their elements instead of the square brackets [] that arrays use and you use a "hash rocket" => to associate a key with a value: 
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/eksmith/09115e506a9cf7bd5fd2.js"></script>

      <p class="post-content">
        You can also use the hash constructor by calling Hash.new to create a new hash, just as we did for arrays above: 
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/eksmith/7ce8e94d2dccfa755e15.js"></script>

      <h3 class="subsubtopic">Accessing Hashes</h3>

      <p class="post-content">
        Unlike with arrays, you do not access hash objects with an index. There is no numbering of the objects in an array because, while you may enter them into your hash in a particular order, the hash doesn't keep track of it. Instead, you access particular values in a hash by using their associated key:
      </p>

      </p>

      <h3 class="subsubtopic">When might you want to use one over the other?</h3>

      <p class="post-content">
        Now, with a solid grasp of what arrays and hashes are, how you can create them, access them, and use them, you might wonder how you should know when to use one or the other.
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        Generally, you can create an array to do the same thing you would do with a hash, but for simplicity and readability you might choose a hash over an array if you need to associate something with something else.
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        Choose a hash if: 
        <ul class="list">
        <li>You need to relate your objects to each other</li>
        <li>The order of your objects does not matter</li>
        <li>You do not have rigid requirements for how to access your objects</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="post-content">
        Choose an array if: 
        <ul class="list">
        <li> You need a simple collection of objects</li> 
        <li> Their order matters</li>
        <li> You need to be able to access them by integers</li>
        </ul>
      </p>


      <p class="post-content">
        Here is an example using a restaurant. If we have a dinner menu at a restaurant, a hash is called for because we need to relate a menu item to a price: 
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/eksmith/03238ebd137910526a96.js"></script>

      <p class="post-content">
        We could achieve the same thing with a multidimensional array, but it's not as readable, easy to access, and the menu items aren't really associated with their prices: 
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/eksmith/f6124dab194277caebb7.js"></script>

      <p class="post-content">
        Further following the theme, in this same restaurant, a waiter taking orders would want to use an array rather than a hash. You might think that a waiter would want to associate a person with their order and thus use a hash, but waiters tend to take down orders based on where the guest is sitting around the table. An array would be more appropriate: 
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/eksmith/99cde0312f433c563464.js"></script>

      <p class="post-content">
        This way, the waiter knows that seat 1, or ticket_21[0] ordered lobster and it will be delivered to the right seat when it's served. With a hash, the seat information is lost and the waiter might not remember where at the table the lobster should go.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subsubtopic">To wrap it all up...</h3>

      <p class="post-content">
        Arrays and hashes are flexible data structures that are easy to create, access, and use. Ruby offers powerful built in methods for these classes and with these, you can write a wide variety of robust programs.
